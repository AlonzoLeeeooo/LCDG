## [Bi-Directional Cascade Network for Perceptual Edge Detection(BDCN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10903.pdf)

This paper proposes a Bi-Directional Cascade Network for edge detection. By introducing a bi-directional cascade structure to enforce each layer to focus on a specific scale, BDCN trains each network layer with a layer-specific supervision. To enrich the multi-scale representations learned with a shallow network, we further introduce a Scale Enhancement
Module (SEM). Here are the code for this paper.


### Prerequisites

- pytorch >= 0.2.0(Our code is based on the 0.2.0)
- numpy >= 1.11.0
- pillow >= 3.3.0

### Train and Evaluation

1. Clone this repository to local
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pkuCactus/BDCN.git
```

2. Download the imagenet pretrained vgg16 pytorch model [vgg16.pth](link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/10Tgjs7FiAYWjVyVgvEM0mA code: ab4g) or the caffemodel from the [model zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) and then transfer to pytorch version. You also can download our pretrained model for only evaluation.
The google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CmDMypSlLM6EAvOt5yjwUQ7O5w-xCm1n/view?usp=sharing).

3. Download the dataset to the local folder

4. running the training code train.py or test code test.py

### Pretrained models

BDCN model for BSDS500 dataset and NYUDv2 datset of RGB and depth are availavble on Baidu Disk.
